# GameOfTheAmazonsV2
This project is an improvement on a previous scope based AI project I did for Game of the Amazons.  It solves for any board size of the game and allows the player to play against the AI. Showing the outcome of the game and best possible move for the player and the best possible reply from the AI for every turn.  The objective of the project was to solve the game for any provided board. And it does so by performing a full depth min max search with possible moves as the search parameter. Possible improvements to the project could be the addition of UI to make playing the game for feasible.
